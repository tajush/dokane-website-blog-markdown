                                <p className='mb-2'>To help you read and understand these Terms, we've set out definitions of some key terms below:</p>
                                <p className='mb-2'>"Customer" means the person or entity who registers to use the Service by creating a DokanE account. If you are creating an account or using the Services on behalf of a business, you agree that you are accepting these Terms and have the authority to enter into these Terms, on behalf of the business, which will be deemed to be the Customer, and will be bound by these Terms.</p>
                                <p className='mb-2'>"Authorised User" means any person or entity that a Customer authorises to use the Service on its behalf. This includes employees and personnel of the Customer who are authorised to use the Services on the Customer's behalf, but also includes support partners and other third parties with whom a Customer shares its DokanE account details (and for whose conduct the Customer is responsible).
                                    “Personal Data” means any Data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person), such as your first and last name, identity number, e-mail address, address and province, telephone number, education details and training records, employment data, financial and / or banking data, as well as other data related to demographics, other (online) contact data and possibly health related data, etc.
                                    “Sensitive Data” means any data revealing a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health data, data about sex life or sexual orientation, or data about criminal convictions and offences.

                                    "We" or "DokanE" means DokanE.
                                </p>
                                <p>"Services" means DokanE point of sale and <a href="/super-shop">inventory management products</a> and services, and any features, technologies or functionality provided by those products or services, offered by us from time to time, including the DokanE POS, DokanE Dashboard, DokanE KDS and DokanE CDS applications ("Apps") and dokanepos.com("Website"). Your use of the Services will also be subject to any allowances and/or limits that apply to the DokanE plan which you've purchased.

                                    "Content" – text, graphics, audio and video materials, documentation, information posted in Apps or Website, perceivable by a person or with the help of special devices.

                                    "You" means the Customer and (where the context permits) includes any Authorised Users.

                                <p className='mb-2'>The fees charged for use of the Services are set out on the Website (or as notified to you in the case of some exclusive plans) ("Fees") and are subject to change. We can change the Fees, and/or introduce new pricing packages and terms, at any time by giving you 14 days' prior notice. The new Fees or pricing/package terms will apply to you from expiry of that notice, unless you choose to cancel subscription before the changes take effect. Also, the new Fees will apply to you immediately if you choose to change your plan/package (or if you reactivate your plan after cancellation). Fees are charged in advance on a monthly or annual basis and are non-refundable, including if you only use part of a month or year's subscription for the Services. Unless required by law, we will not provide refunds in connection with the Services. A valid credit card number is required for paying all Fees.
                                </p>
                                <p className='mb-2'>If you are carrying out a free trial of the Services, the free trial will begin on the day that you subscribe for an optional add-on and end of the published trial period. If you wish to continue to use the Services at the end of the free trial period, you will need to provide valid credit card details (unless you choose to use any free Services). All Fees are exclusive of all taxes and you are responsible for any taxes that may arise. You indemnify and hold DokanE harmless against any claims by any tax authority for any underpayment of any sales, use, goods and services, value added or other tax or levy, and any penalties and/or interest. If you are required to withhold or deduct tax from the Fees, you will pay DokanE such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure receipt of the full amount which would have been received but for the deduction.
                                    By subscribing to optional add-ons, you agree and authorize us to automatically charge the payment method provided at the start of each billing period (monthly or annually) until you cancel the subscription.
                                </p>
                                <p>Payment of your Fees could incur additional bank fees at the discretion of your bank. Bank fees may be charged for currency conversion and international settlement; and your charge may still be subject to additional fees even if you are being charged by DokanE in your local currency. If your credit card statement charge differs from your invoice, please contact your bank in the first instance. DokanE is not liable for any additional bank transaction fees that may be charged.</p>

                                <p className='mb-2'>The upgrade or downgrade will become effective immediately. If you downgrade your account, no refunds will be paid in respect of any unused portion of any higher account offering. If you upgrade your account, the balance already paid for the rest of the term will be credited to your account. We will then immediately charge your credit card for any net amount due as a result of the upgrade and your account renewal date will be reset to the next available billing day.
